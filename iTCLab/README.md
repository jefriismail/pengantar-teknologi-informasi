iTCLab is an enhanced version of the TCLab developed by Prof. John Hedengren from Brigham Young University, further improved by Mr. Basuki Rakhmat from UPN "Veteran" Jawa Timur. 

## Key Features

- **Enhanced Communication:** iTCLab replaces the original microcontroller with an ESP32, enabling internet connectivity.
  
- **Expanded Functionality:** While retaining the core methods of TCLab, iTCLab extends its capabilities to include PID control, system control, AI integration, and more.
  
## Research Support

Numerous academic papers have utilized iTCLab for research purposes, including:

- [iTCLab Temperature Monitoring and Control System Based on PID and Internet of Things (IoT)](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/itclab-temperature-monitoring-and-control-system-based-on-pid-and-internet-of-things-iot/319461)
